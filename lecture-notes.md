# CS214 (Systems Programming) Lecture Notes

## Lecture 1 - Course Overview
Systems Programming:

### Run time System
    - standard library features like IO, memory management, etc

### What is an OS (operating systems):
- Shared implementation of commonly used features
- Management of shared resources
    - protect programs from other programs
    - protect users from other users
    - maintain abstractions
- common utilities
    - UI

### How will we learn about systems programming?
- C programming language
- Unix-style operating system (Linux, Posix)
    - posix -> portable OS
    - files and file systems
    - multitasking, process control (and how to manage them)
    - multi-threading (pthread library)
    - network communication (sockets, Posix library)
